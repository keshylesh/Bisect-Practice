This is a practice repository for practicing git bisect. 

git bisect is a very useful tool that allows you to use binary search to search
through commits. This helps in figuring out where an error popped up, and might
be useful through this course and in the future!

To get started, look up git bisect, you will mainly be using these commands:
- git bisect start
- git bisect good
- git bisect bad

When you have figured out the first commit to have this error, pick that commit
hash in the Google Form. 

Good luck!
