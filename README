* Info *
This is a practice repository for practicing git bisect. 

git bisect is a very useful tool that allows you to use binary search to search
through commits. This helps in figuring out where an error popped up, and might
be useful through this course and in the future!

* The Problem *
The code in this repository contains a file called calc.cc, which runs a simple
calculator program. It takes two numbers and calculates either their sum or the 
product.

This sounds like a simple program! Let's try it out:
- First run make, we now have an executable called 'calc'
- Let's run it and pick 3 and 4
- Try multiplying them with the program. This seems alright!
- Now run it again and try adding them...oh! That seems to be the product and not the sum :(

We're going to sleuth around and figure out where exactly this error occurred.
To get started, let's look up git bisect and try using it.

* Hint *
The very first commit had working addition code. Here's the hash for it: f07c33cf803e53ddb66a26b451e305e778319c9e. 
It looks long, but git is really smart at filling in details, so we can just 
use the first few characters of a hash to reference it! In this case, just 'f07c' is enough.

For the bad commit, we know that our latest commit is not working, what marker can we use for it?

When you have figured out the first commit to have this error, pick that commit
hash in the Google Form. 

* Additional info *
There are commits prior to adding the Makefile! This is not an error, and
is intended, think about what you need to do here to get the executable.

At no point during this exercise will you need to add files to the directory.

If you would like to stop your bisect you can run 'git bisect reset', and start
over.

Good luck!
