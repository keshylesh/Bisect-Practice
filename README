This is a practice repository for practicing git bisect. 

git bisect is a very useful tool that allows you to use binary search to search
through commits. This helps in figuring out where an error popped up, and might
be useful through this course and in the future!

To get started, look up git bisect, you will mainly be using these commands:
- git bisect start
- git bisect good
- git bisect bad

When you have figured out the first commit to have this error, pick that commit
hash in the Google Form. 

*Hint*: the very first commit had working addition code. 
Here's the hash for it: f07c33cf803e53ddb66a26b451e305e778319c9e. 
git is really smart at filling in details, so you just need the first few
characters of a hash to reference it! In this case, just f07c is enough.

There are commits prior to adding the Makefile! This is not an error, and
is intended, think about what you need to do here.

At no point during this exercise will you need to add files to the directory.

Good luck!
